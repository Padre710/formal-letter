        Appeal for better roads in lagos.
      </h4>
      <p> I , on behalf of all the residents of Lagos state write to draw your attention towards to state of our roads in lagos state. 
        The roads have seriously deteriorated and this has led to a large number of accidents. 
        Years back, these roads were very good but due to little or no maintenance the roads have developed pot holes
         that are large enough to fit a whole child. When people drive in the night they are unable to see these
          pot holes and their vehicles get stuck there.
         Also, half of the traffic in lagos is due to the substandard roads.

      <p> I know that the government has been doing a lot of work in trying to eradicate crime 
        and we are grateful for your continuous efforts ; we will also be glad if you look into
         this road problem by providing road maintenance services. If these roads are not fixed, 
         it will further increase the crime rate because arm robbers use the traffic as an opportunity to rob citizens.
          I hope that you grant our request. Thank you
